### Problem Statement

Recruiters and hiring managers receive hundreds of resumes for every job opening, making it challenging to manually screen applications efficiently. Traditional Application Tracking Systems (ATS) often filter out candidates based on rigid keyword matching, which can overlook qualified applicants. At the same time, candidates struggle to understand how well their resume aligns with a specific job description, leading to missed opportunities.

- There is a need for a smart, AI-powered solution that can:

- Evaluate resumes against job descriptions like an ATS, providing a match percentage.

- Highlight missing keywords that reduce the resume’s chances of passing ATS filters.

- Generate a profile summary and final thoughts to guide candidates in improving their applications.

- Offer an HR-style evaluation that highlights strengths and weaknesses from a recruiter’s perspective.

- This project, Smart ATS Resume Tracker, addresses this gap by combining ATS-style evaluation with human-resource insights, powered by Google Gemini AI.
